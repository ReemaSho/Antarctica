            Antarctica is about 98 percent covered in ice. There's 30 million cubic kilometers of ice, or 90 percent of
            all
            the ice on our planet. Even more superlatives: in Antarctica you will find 70 percent of all fresh water
            (frozen admittedly) of the world. The Antarctic ice is the oldest ice in the world, older than the eternal
            snow in the Himalayas, older than the ice sheet at the North Pole, older than the glaciers in the Alps.
            <img class="right border" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.0XUZ9GO2OXFZHlKB94EBCgHaE8?pid=ImgDet&rs=1"
                alt="">About 95 percent of the ice in Antarctica is glacial ice. This ice was created because the snow
            is compressed more strongly year after year. Because there are almost no air bubbles left in it, the ice
            often has a blue or green appearance. The huge ice mass that accumulates on the Antarctic continent must
            also undergo the law of gravity. The ice slides to the lower coast. This creates glaciers- a kind of ice
            rivers.

            But that sliding doesn't go so smoothly. Slipping down a slope is only possible if there is a thin layer of
            water under the glacier. If it's too cold, the glacier just gets stuck. So the ice doesn't all slide down as
            quickly. This creates fissures in the glacial ice that can be up to tens of meters wide. Often those
            fissures are covered with a thin layer of snow. Many polar explorers were killed by unsuspectingly stepping
            on it and falling into the immeasurable depths. Large glacier crevices can only be crossed via an unstable
            snow bridge that connects both sides. Antarctica is home to the longest glacier in the world: the Lambert
            Glacier, which is 250 miles long.

            When the glaciers reach the coast, they form ice cliffs or ice shelves. The ice shelves, because the ice
            rubs over the seabed, are deformed at the bottom into protrusions and wrinkles that hold the ice shelf in
            place. The most famous ice shelf is the Ross Ice Shelf. It is also the largest, about the same size as
            France. At the place where the plateau hits the land it is 900 meters thick, at the front 200 meters. Other
            large ice shelves include the Amery Ice Shelf, the Filchner Shelf and the Ronne Ice Shelf

            With the view of several hundred scientists, Antarctica is uninhabited. Yet it is teeming with life,
            especially along the coasts of the continent. Antarctica is home to eight penguin species. Countless seals
            laze on ice floes. Whales come to stuff their voluminous bellies with krill. Millions of birds let
            themselves be swept away by the indomitable wind. The most invisible are the fish, which amazingly do not
            freeze in the icy Antarctic waters.
            Seals unwittingly played a major role in the discovery of Antarctica. Robben hunters discovered quite a bit
            of land during their poaching trips. But the discovery of these new areas was almost accompanied by the
            extinction of some seal species.

            Today, the seals are protected by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. Only a limited
            number of seals may be caught for scientific research

        <p class="text-fontsize">For a long time, Antarctica was hiding. It wasn't until the 19th century that human
            eyes first saw it. That
            made Antarctica the last continent discovered.<img class="right border "
                src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gettyimages-517203600.jpg"
                alt=""> It was not until 1911 that the heart of Antarctica, the
            geographical south pole, was reached. The discovery of Antarctica is one of heroic stories. The first
            explorers sailed their sailboats among the life-threatening ice floes. In the early 20th century, bold
            men
            trekked through the white desert on foot or with a sled. Many lost their lives or were maimed because a
            limb
            froze off it. But all polar explorers gave the world exciting adventure stories.
            The names of explorers and their sovereigns and benefactors are written on Antarctica’s shores. Renowned
            explorers from Cook to Amundsen and Scott all tried to penetrate this vast, mysterious land: each with
            varying degrees of success. Visitors can follow in their footsteps and imagine what it was like to forge
            through the pack ice on a creaking wooden boat or to haul sledges across the polar plateau. Some of the
            historic huts actually remain, preserved frozen in rime ice, to tell the story of adventures long past.</p>

        <div class="first-column text-fontsize">You may be surprised, but there are also lakes in Antarctica. However,
            some are not so easy to find.
            They are located deep under the thick ice sheet. About 145 have been inventoried. Most are located in East
            Antarctica.

            The largest of the Antarctic subglacial lakes is Lake Vostok, which lies almost four kilometres below
            the
            ice sheet.
            Other well-known lakes include Lake Ellsworth and Lake Whillans, both in West Antarctica. In
            2012
            Russia managed to drill all the way to Lake Vostok. In 2013, U.S. scientists reached the waters of Lake
            Whillans. Britain began drilling for Lake Ellsworth in 2012, but due to technical problems, the project
            has
            been temporarily halted.</div>
        <div class="lake-container z-order">

            <div class="lake-text1 text-fontsize">
                Scientists are particularly interested in these lakes under the ice sheet. The water is cut off from the
                outside world for a very long time (in the case of Lake Vostok for more than 20 million
                years).Scientists
                hope to find new life forms that give us a glimpse back in time. And if life were to be found in the
                lakes,
                it means that life could exist in much more extreme places than was thought possible until now,
                including on
                other planets.In 2013, British scientists already found traces of life in Lake Hodgson (Antarctic
                Peninsula). In the
                sediments at the bottom they found microbes.</div>

                In the upper layers, they discovered living microbes. At
                greater depths (3.2 meters deep), they found remnants of microbes that lived there about 100,000 years
                ago.
                And that in particularly extreme circumstances. The lake has been covered in ice for at least 100,000
                years.
                All this time, these microbes have had no contact with the outside world and lived in the dark.

                Microorganisms are also teeming in Lake Whillans, as became known in August 2014. In the water samples
                examined, scientists found mainly single-celled organisms called Archaea.</div>

                ash-covered snow,
                and hidden chinstrap
                penguin rookery at Baily Head, Deception Island offers the rare
                opportunity to sail inside a volcano. Now classified as having ‘a significant volcanic risk,’ Deception
                remains a favorite for the industrial archaeology of its abandoned whaling station, half-destroyed by an
                eruption-induced mudflow and flood. Some will stop for a quick dip in the island’s heated geothermal
                currents.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-fontsize">One of the major pay-offs of the long passage across the Southern Ocean
                is the chance
                to spot migrating
                whales circulating through
                krill-rich waters. Once nearer to land calling it whale-watching , if you’re in a Zodiac, doesn’t do it
                justice: you could be close enough to get a ‘whale bath.' The whale exhales with a startlingly loud
                ‘fffffffffffffff!’ right next to your boat, leaving you bathed in fish-scented mist. Near the ice edge,
                look for orcas hunting in pods.</p>
